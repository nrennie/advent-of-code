# Advent of Code 2022

A repository containing code for Advent of Code challenges. Check out the challenge at [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com/). 


## Day 1
I wouldn't normally use a `for` loop for this type of problem in R, but I thought it would be interesting to compare R, Python, and Julia using the same method.

## Day 2
The perfect use case for `case_when()` in R.

## Day 3
A combination of functions from {stringr} and `intersect()` from base R, made this one reasonably easy.
