You can also see my solutions 

## Day 1
I wouldn't normally use a `for` loop for this type of problem in R, but I thought it would be interesting to compare R, Python, and Julia using the same method.

## Day 2
The perfect use case for `case_when()` in R.

## Day 3
A combination of functions from {stringr} and `intersect()` from base R, made this one reasonably easy.

## Day 4
This one wasn't too difficult - a combination of `separate()` from {tidyr}, and either `all()` or `any()` from base R.

## Day 5
This one was tricky - most of the time was spent reading in the data... I initially started using a matrix to represent the data, but quickly found that a list worked better.

## Day 6
A rolling window to count up the number of unique values solved this one quite quickly.
