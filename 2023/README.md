# Advent of Code 2023

A repository containing code for Advent of Code challenges. Check out the challenge at [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com/). 

## Day 1
Lots of use for {stringr} and regular expressions using `gregexpr()` and a lookahead pattern to deal with overlapping matches.

## Day 2
Used `separate_wider_delim()` from {tidyr} to separate data into multiple columns, thereafter simple summary stats can compute the answer.

## Day 3
Lots of nested `for` loops and `if` statements.

## Day 4
Reasonably straightforward with a simple `for` loop.

## Day 5
Brute force solution. *Need a bit more time to get part 2*.

## Day 6
Simple solution using the quadratic formula.

## Day 7
*Still to do*.

## Day 8
*Still to do*.

## Day 9
Making use of lists.
